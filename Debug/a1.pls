Course Description

Introduction to the basic principles, techniques, and tools used to translate text expressed in one language to
equivalent text expressed in another language. The concepts discussed and the programming concepts studied in
previous courses are applied to develop and program the front-end of a simple compiler or interpreter using ANSI C
as implementation language. The ideas and techniques discussed could be applied to general software design and
to parsing of structured files, such as HTML, XML, register and configuration files.
